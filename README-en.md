C++ Mp3-Player

[Original Post](https://www.cnblogs.com/fox-nest/p/13216655.html)

An unexpected discovery while [surfing the web](https://www.cnblogs.com/fox-nest/p/13216655.html), I added a graphical interface~~(command line)~~ to it.

Please place your mp3 audio **(only in English)** into the `Music` folder, then run Music.exe.

Press the 'Space' to pause/continue, 'ESC' to stop, 'A' or 'a' for the previous track, 'D' or 'd' for the next track.

Then start enjoying.
