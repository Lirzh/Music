C++ Mp3-Player

[Original Post](https://www.cnblogs.com/fox-nest/p/13216655.html)

An unexpected discovery while [surfing the web](https://www.cnblogs.com/fox-nest/p/13216655.html), and I've added a graphical interface to it ~~(command line)~~.

------

Download this [Music-en.exe](https://github.com/Lirzh/Music/releases/download/Begin_End/Music-en.exe).

Create a folder named `Music` in the same directory as Music.exe, and put your mp3 audio **(only in English)** into the `Music` folder, then run Music.exe.

Press 'Space' to pause/resume, 'ESC' to stop.
'W' or 'w' for the previous track, 'S' or 's' for the next track.
'A' or 'a' key will rewind by 5 seconds, 'D' or 'd' key to advance 5 seconds forward.

Then start enjoying(It can automatically play the next song and display a progress bar).
